# JavaQuestions
This repo contains several questions one can practice for coding interviews. The questions are mostly solved in Java, but the principles would apply to other languages for the most part.

Use the following resources to prepare for SWE interviews. Note that this is not an exhaustive list, and does not replace real life experience :-)
- Book - Cracking the coding Interview [At minimum, go over Ch. 2 (Linked List), 4 (Trees & Graphs), 6 (Math & Logic Puzzles),
    8 (Recursion & Dynamic Programming), and 9 (System Design & Scalability)].
<br>
- Book - Elements of Programming Interviews [At minimum, go over Ch. 16 (Recursion), 17 (Dynamic Programming),
    20 (Parallel Computing), 21 (Design Problems), 25 (Honors Class)].

Few tips:
=============
- For questions with recursive solution, practice the iterative solution too. This is a common Interview variation
<br>
- Calculate the Big-O notation for space & time complexity for all questions.
<br>
- Practice questions in IDE, whiteboard, as well as in online tools such as coderpad.
<br>
- Remember the .length() vs .size() vs .length vs .count vs .count() variations in common structures.
    + String: s.length()
    + Array: arr.length
    + HashSet: s.size()
    + HashMap: m.size()
    + List: l.size()
    + LinkedList: l.size()
<br>
- Remember Common Data Structure functions:
    + String:
        .length()
        .charAt(index)
        .toCharArray()
    + HashMap:
        .put(key, value)
        .get(key)
        .containsKey(key)
        .size()
